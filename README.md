# OGPanic Starter

OGPanic is a web service for generating beautiful and eye-catching og-images. As OGPanic uses headless chrome to render the images, there's basically no limits for what you can put inside the image. You can use web fonts, add beatiful gradients, and other fancy visuals effects that can be implemented by modern CSS and Javascript.

## Developing the template

Register on https://ogpanic.com to get the API endpoint and API token.

Clone this repo and create a `.env.development`, or copy the `example.env.example` file to create one. Then fill in the API endpoint and token from OGPanic's dashboard.

```
OGPANIC_ENDPOINT=https://ogaas-app-1.ogpanic.com
OGPANIC_TOKEN=AabE@G-13
```

Run the following command to start developing your own template.

```bash
$ npm install
# npx ogaas develop --help, for more infomation
$ npm run develop
```

The template editor can be found at `http://localhost:3000/editor` to preview your og-image.

### Source code structure

Templates are under `./src` with each of them in different directories. The directory name will be used as the template's name for rendering the og-image.

e.g. The name of template under ./src/blog will be `blog`, and image generated by this template can be accessed via `https://<endpoint>/og/blog/<id>.<jpeg|png>`.

Under `./src/<template_name>`, there will be 2 mandatory files: `index.html`, `data.json`. And you can add image and stylesheets and other resources if required.


### Preparing the meta data

OGPanic allow you the specify only the id (slug) to access the generated og-image. Only who have uploaded the meta data of that id can determine what data to be shown in the image. `data.json` is the file to hold your mockup meta data when designing the template.

`id` will be used as the slug for the image and in `data`, you can put whatever you need for generating the final image.

```json
{"id": "first-blog", "data": {"name": "A great blog"}}
```

In a production environment, it is recommended to upload the meta data when the page is created or updated. You can use the [API](#api) or the [command line tool](#command-line) for uploading data to OGPanic.


### Filling data to the templates

This is the template html that is used to generate your og-image. With the example meta data above and the following template.

```html
<h1>{{name}}</h1>
```

You will get the following. Use CSS to adjust the typo and position to make it look great!

```html
<h1>A great blog</h1>
```

## Upload meta data

When developing the templates with `npm run develop`, any changes to mockup data in data.json will automatically uploaded.

Use the following code to upload the data in production environment. You can either define `OGPANIC_ENDPOINT`, `OGPANIC_TOKEN` as environment variables or put then in the `.env` file.

```javascript
import { uploadMeta } from 'ogaas-cli'

await uploadMeta([
    {id: "my-first-blog", data: {"name": "A awesome blog title"}}
])
```

You can also using the following command to upload.

```bash
# npx ogaas upload --help, for more infomation
$ npx ogaas upload <data.json>
```

## Build & deploy the templates

You can deploy the templates by hitting `DEPLOY TEMPLATES` button on editor UI or by command line.

Build the templates.

```bash
# npx ogaas build --help, for more infomation
$ npm run build
```

Upload the built templates. Run `npm run build` before using this command.

note: Make sure you have the `.env.production` and correct API endpoint/token setup.

```bash
# npx ogaas deploy --help, for more infomation
$ npm run deploy
```
